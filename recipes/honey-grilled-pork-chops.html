       <h3>Description</h3>
       <p>Pork chops marinated in a honey glaze and grilled.</p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>6 pork chops</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
            <li>Whisk honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, and garlic together in a bowl until marinade is smooth. Pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag, reserving about 1/4 of the marinade in a bowl for basting. 
                Add the pork chops to the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag; marinate in the refrigerator at least 5 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork chops from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Grill pork chops on the preheated grill, basting with the reserved marinade during the last few minutes, until pork chops are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let pork chops rest for 3 minutes before serving.</li>
       </ol>
